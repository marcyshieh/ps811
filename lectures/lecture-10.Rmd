# Goals

- For me to share my replication project that I was very proud of at the time

- For you to witness an application of the replication workflow in action and get some practice manipulating more data

- Hopefully this is helpful for both your 812 replication project and seminar papers

# A note on replications

- Even the most often-cited articles have errors

- Errors only matter if they change the findings
